The Oscilloscope is a must-have test instrument for any electronics engineer. It is used to visualize and observe various signals, usually as a two-dimensional plot with one or more signals plotted against time. They are used in the design and debugging of electronic devices to view and compare waveforms, and determine voltage levels, frequency, noise and other parameters of signals applied at its input as it changes with time. This makes Oscilloscopes a very important tool on the desk of an electronics engineer or maker. However, Oscilloscopes are pretty expensive, they cost between 30000₹ to 100000₹ for entry-level oscilloscopes. And the advanced oscilloscopes cost lakhs of rupees, which puts them beyond the reach of basic users. But what if we could create one which is cheaper, compact, and easy to make? That is the question that led to today’s tutorial.
